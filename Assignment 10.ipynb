    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The shutil module in Python provides functions for file and directory operations. Two commonly used functions in this module \n",
    "are shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree(), which are used to copy files and directories, respectively. Here's how we can \n",
    "distinguish between them :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) shutil.copy() :\n",
    "\n",
    "    * shutil.copy(src, dst) is used to copy a single file from the source (src) to the destination (dst).\n",
    "    * It creates a new file at the destination with the same content as the source file.\n",
    "    * If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "    * The src argument should be the path to the source file, and the dst argument should be the path to the destination file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) shutil.copytree() :\n",
    "\n",
    "    * shutil.copytree(src, dst) is used to recursively copy an entire directory from the source (src) to the destination (dst).\n",
    "    * It copies the entire directory tree, including all its subdirectories and files.\n",
    "    * If the destination directory already exists, it will raise an error unless the ignore argument is provided to handle \n",
    "      conflicts.\n",
    "    * The src argument should be the path to the source directory, and the dst argument should be the path to the destination\n",
    "      directory.\n",
    "        \n",
    "In summary, shutil.copy() is used for copying individual files, while shutil.copytree() is used for copying entire directories\n",

    "Ques 2.) What function is used to rename files ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The shutil module in Python also provides a function called shutil.move() that can be used to rename files or directories.\n",
    "Although the primary purpose of this function is to move files and directories, it can effectively be used for renaming as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we can use shutil.move() to rename a file :\n",
    "\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "old_name = '/path/to/old_file.txt'\n",
    "new_name = '/path/to/new_file.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.move(old_name, new_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, old_name is the path to the file we want to rename, and new_name is the desired new name (including the\n",
    "path and file extension, if applicable). The shutil.move() function will rename the file accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the file specified by new_name already exists, shutil.move() will overwrite it. If we want to avoid overwriting \n",
    "existing files, we can perform a check before renaming or use a different approach, such as checking for file existence or \n",
    "creating a new file with the desired name and copying the contents."

    "Ques 3.) What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The send2trash and shutil modules in Python provide functions to delete files or directories, but they differ in their behavior\n",
    "and the way they handle the deletion process :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) send2trash module :\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The send2trash module provides a function called send2trash() that sends files or directories to the system's recycle bin \n",
    "      or trash instead of permanently deleting them.\n",
    "    * It acts as a safer alternative to directly deleting files, as it allows recovery from the recycle bin or trash if \n",
    "      necessary.\n",
    "    * The send2trash(path) function takes the path to the file or directory we want to delete and sends it to the recycle bin\n",
    "      or trash.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2.) shutil module :\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The shutil module provides various functions for file and directory operations, including deletion.\n",
    "    * The shutil.rmtree() function is commonly used to delete directories and their contents recursively.\n",
    "    * The os.remove() function is used to delete individual files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Key differences :\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'send2trash()' sends files or directories to the recycle bin or trash, while 'shutil.rmtree()' and 'os.remove()' directly\n",
    "   delete them.\n",
    "* 'send2trash()' allows for potential recovery from the recycle bin or trash, while 'shutil.rmtree()' and 'os.remove()' result \n",
    "   in permanent deletion.\n",
    "* 'send2trash()' is generally used for user-friendly deletion, while 'shutil.rmtree()' and 'os.remove()' are typically used for\n",
    "   permanent deletion in scripting or automated tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In summary, the send2trash module offers a safer approach by sending files or directories to the recycle bin or trash, while\n",
    "the shutil module provides functions for permanent deletion. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and\n",
    "use case of our application."

    "\n",
    "# Close the ZIP archive\n",
    "zip_obj.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the ZipFile() constructor method is used to open the file 'archive.zip' in read mode ('r'). This creates\n",
    "a ZipFile object (zip_obj) that can be used to perform various operations on the ZIP archive. Once we are done working with the\n",
    "ZipFile object, we should call its close() method to release any system resources associated with it.\n",

    "Note that the ZipFile() constructor can also be used to create a new ZIP archive or open an existing one in write mode ('w') or\n",
    "append mode ('a'). The appropriate mode is specified as the second argument to the constructor method.\n",
